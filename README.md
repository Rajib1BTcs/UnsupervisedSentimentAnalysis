# Sentiment Analysis on Unlabeled Data
In this notebook, I use basic techniques to do sentiment analysis on unlabeled data extracted from FlipBoard.

Outline:

 - Extract data from Flipboard from their Sports, Technology, Business, Science and Politics subpages
 - Preprocess and clean the data using some standard techniques
 - Text Parsing using POS and chunk tagging
 - Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagging
 - Sentiment Analysis using AFINN and TextBlob
